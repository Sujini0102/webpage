    <h2>GRAPHIC DESIGN</h2>
    <p>Graphic design is a craft where professionals create visual content to communicate messages.
     By applying visual hierarchy and page layout techniques, designers use typography and pictures to meet users' specific
     needs and focus on the logic of displaying elements in interactive designs, to optimize the user experience.

    <h2>TYPOGRAPHY</h2>
    <p style="background-color: pink;color:rgb(31, 14, 28);"><i>
    Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed.
     The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing, and letter-spacing, as well as 
     adjusting the space between pairs of letters.</i></p>

          <h4>TYPOGRAPHY</h4>
          <h5>Characteristics</h5>
          <p>Width of the font characters, just as their weight, is quickly recognized 
            and strongly affects readability and visibility of a piece of writing.
            The difference between the main and additional strokes is called font contrast.
             Contrast defines a font position on a legibility/appearance scale.</p>

        <div class="column" style="background-color:#f473d4;font-size: 20px;">
          <h4>VISUAL COMMUNICATION</h4>
          <h5>Characteristics</h5>
          <p>Visual communication refers to the use of images, shapes, colours and patterns to 
        convey meaning. Effective visual communication relies on a well-considered graphic 
        design strategy that takes into account the audienceâ€™s needs and preferences. There 
        are key elements of visual communication: image, shape, colour, pattern and spatial
         arrangement.</p>

        <div class="column" style="background-color:#be8df4;font-size: 20px;">
          <h4>ILLUSTRATION</h4>
          <h5>Characteristics</h5>
          <p>The designer can draw the outline of people or objects and highlight the different
        elements of the illustration which the author wishes to bring to the fore for the 
        purpose of his instruction. Separate images can be drawn to follow the successive
        stages of a process. Drawings should be as true to life as possible.
